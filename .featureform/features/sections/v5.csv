section3,"Latinx business owners drops from percent to percent. Latinx business owners had a n “unfavorable” industry distribution partly placing them at higher risk of business losses. Asian business owners show a similar pattern. I also find that they were more concentrated in industries placing them at a higher risk of losse s. White business owners experienced the same level of losses when switching to the national industry distribution as expected given their large representation of the total. Interestingly, the large loss in the number of immigrant business owners is not d ue to a less favorable industry distribution. The loss of . million immigrant business owners (or percent) remains essentially unchanged when switching to the national industry distribution. U.S. born (“native”) business owners also have an industry d istribution that is similar to the national distribution consistent with the size of the group. Another way to estimate industry impacts is to examine the percentage of each demographic group that is in “essential” industries. As note d above the classific ation is not perfect and other factors such as differences in customer demand, enforcement and compliance by businesses also influence whether they are open. The percentage of black business owners in essential industries is percent which is lower than the national percentage of percent , and consistent with the less “favorable” industry distribution placing them at higher risk of losses due to COVID- . Similarly, female -owned businesses are less concentrated in essential businesses at percent. On the other hand, using the Delaware codes, Latinx and immigrant business owners are slightly more likely to be concentrated in essential industries ( - percent), and Asian business owners have the same concentration in essential industries as the nationa l average ( percent). The classification is likely to be imperfect and does not line up entirely well with patterns of group -specific losses. . Conclusions The first estimates of the effects of COVID - on the number of business owners from nationally representative April CPS data indicate dramatic early -stage reductions in small business activity. The number of active business owners in the United States plunged from . million to . million over the crucial two -month window from February to April . No other one -, two - or even -month window of time has ever shown such a large change in business activity. For comparison, from the start to end of the Great Recession the number of business owners decreased by , representing only a percent reduction . In general , business ownership is relatively steady over the business cycle (Fairlie ; Parker ). The loss of . million business owners (or percent) was comprised of large drops in important subgroups such as owners working roughly two days per week ( percent), owners working four days a week ( percent) , and incorporated businesses ( percent ). African -American businesses were hit the hardest by COVID -. The first estimates from April for black business owners in t he United States indicate a massive drop of percent . Simulations indicate that the industry distribution of blacks was partly responsible placing black business owners at greater risk of losses due to the pandemic . Latinx businesses were also hit hard b y COVID- losing percent of business owners. Asian business owners experienced a percent decline over the critical two -month window. Simulation estimates also point to unfavorable industry distributions for these two groups. Immigrant businesses wer e also devastated with losses of percent. The negative early -stage impacts on minority - and immigrant -owned businesses , if prolonged, may be problematic for broader racial inequality because of the importance of minority businesses for local job creatio n (disproportionately for other minorities), e conomic advancement, and longer -term wealth inequality (Bo ston , ; Bradford , ; Fairlie and Robb ) . The first estimates of early stage impacts on female- owned businesses are also worrisome. Female business ownership is substantially lower than male business ownership and female -owned businesses have lower revenues, employees and profits on average (U.S. Census Bureau ). The disproportionate losses in April to the number of female business owners will only further increase gender inequality in business ownership and perhaps broader economic inequality. The next important question is whether the shutdowns of small businesses are temporary or longer term. The government has been responding to concerns over longer -term effects on small businesses through several programs. The largest directed program is the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) which has thus far provided $ billion to small business es (although with some controversy when businesses such as Ruth’s Chris Steak House, Potbelly Sandwich Shop s, and the Lakers received approval for funds). Another program that is less directed but also could be important are stimulus checks already totaling $ billion. Foundations are also starting to contribute to relief efforts with a notable recent example being a $ million commitment to minority - and female -owned businesses left out of the PPP program by Magic Johnson Enterprises. Can these programs help small businesses survive the setbacks and shutdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic, or will more assistance be needed? More permanent mass closures of small businesses in the United States are likely to have a dramatic effect on employee job losses, further income inequality, and con tributing to a prolonged recession."
section2,"unprecedented . Conditioning on or more hours worked results in losses of . million or percent (see Table ) . Separating the number of business owners into unincorporated and incorporated status indicates large drops for both groups (see Table ) . Incorporated businesses are viewed as more growth - oriented, committed, pro -cyclica l and entrepreneurial (e.g. Fairlie, Miranda and Zolas ; Levine and Rubinstein , ) . The number of unincoporated business owners dropped precipitously from . million to . million ( percent). But, incorporated business owners were not immune to the COVID - impacts. The number of i ncorporated business owners in the United States dropped from . million to . million ( percent). Demographic Patterns The CPS data provide detailed information on gender, race and immigrant status. Figure (Table ) displays the number of female and male business owners in February and April . Female businesses were especially hit hard by COVID -. The number of female business owners dropped from . million to . million in the crucial two -month windo w. The decline of one - fourth of female business owners is unprecedented. Male business owners also suffered major losses with a reduction of million representing percent of previous levels . Turning to racial patterns, Figure (Table ) displays busi ness ownership by major racial groups. The findings are alarming. The number of African -American business owners plummeted from . million in February to , in April. The loss of , black business owners representing percent of the previ ous level is disconcerting . Latinx business owners also suffered major losses. The number of Latinx business owners dropped from . million to . million ( percent) from February to March. Asian business owners suffered losses of , representing percent of February levels. The losses for whites were also large at . million business owners, but smaller as a percentage of starting levels ( percent). Focusing on immigrants, the number of busin ess owners dropped from . million to . million (Figure and Table ) . The loss of over million immigrant business owners is alarming . It represents a drop of percent from February levels. For U.S. born, the number of business owners dropped by . million representing percent of February leve ls. Comparing back to April levels , the conclusions do not differ. For all of the demographic groups, the number of business owners dropped precipitously rom April to April . In general, the number of self -employed business owners for each g roup does not change substantially over time especially during stable economic conditions , and thus February accurately captures previous levels . April is clearly a n unprecedented shock to business owners that hit all groups hard throwing busines s totals off relatively stable longer -term levels. Industry Patterns Table reports estimates by major industry groupings. Almost every industry experienced sizeable drops in the number of business owners. The only exception was Agriculture where the number of business owners increased since February . Construction which is some cases is considered essential experienced a major decline of nearly , business owners in the United States. Although construction businesses experience a lot of swings in demand, it is not clear how many of these business owners will be able to come back. Store fronts across the country have been closed due to COVID - mandated restrictions. Retail trade showed a decline of , business owners representing percent of February levels. Restaurants experienced a decline of percent even though many of those remaining open turned to take -out or delivery services. The broad sector of arts, leisure and accommodations was hit especially hard losing percent of business owners. Both high -skilled and less -skilled s ervices were hit hard by COVID -. Transportation services which includes taxi and some uber drivers dropped by percent. Higher -skilled services such as financial activities and professional and business services lost percent and percent, respectively. Even health services experienced a drop of percent. Although there is some variation across industries COVID - had large impacts on all of them with the exception of agriculture. It is also possible to categorize industries into essential vs no n-essential according to state or local government guidelines , although there is a lot of variation across these guidelines in terms of specific industries. Delaware State provides the most detailed and comprehensive list of essential businesses at the -digit industry level and follows the same -digit industry codes as the CPS (North American Industry Classification System, NAICS). The classification is likely to be imperfect, however, because definitions, enforcement, business owner compliance and consu mer reactions vary across the country. Using this categorization , “essential” industries comprise percent of business owners. Losses in the number of business owners are lower for essential industries at percent compared with percent among non-essential industries (as expected) . Importance of Industry Distributions Did the industry distribution of businesses owned by different demographic groups place them at a higher or lower risk of COVID related shutdowns? To explore this question I sim ulate the total number of business owners for each demographic group by switching their industry distribution for the U.S. national industry distribution . The industry distributions are both measured in February . Table reports estimates from the sim ulations. The number of female business owners declined by percent from February to March . The industry distribution of female business owners was partly responsible for relatively high business losses from February to April. When switching to the U.S. national industry distribution the decline in business owners is lower at percent. Thus, the female industry distribution was “unfavorable” in terms of placing them at risk of business losses in April . The opposite is true for male business o wners. Their industry distribution partly protected them from larger losses due to COVID- . Switching industry distributions to the national distribution results in a higher predicted d rop in business owners of percent. For both female and male busines s owners the differences between actual and predicted declines due to COVID - are not that different, however. The industry distribution of black business owners placed them at a higher risk of losses due to COVID -. The percent change in black business owners becomes considerably smaller when simulations are run with the national industry distribution. The change is from a loss of percent to a loss of percent. A similar pattern is found for Latinx although to a lesser extent. When switching the Latinx industry distribution to the U.S. national industry distribution the predicted number of Delaware’s list can be accessed at “List of Delaware Business Categories that are Essential and Non -Essential (March , )”, https://coronavirus .delaware.gov/resources -for-businesses/."
section1,"Most major industries faced large drops in the number of business owners with the only exception being agriculture. Construction, restaurants, hotels and transportation all faced large declines in the number of business owners due to COVID -. Simulations reveal that the concentrations of female, black, Latinx and Asian businesses in industries hit hard by the pandemic contributed to why losses were higher for these groups than the national average loss. Overall, these first estimates of impacts of COVID - on small business es from the April CPS indicate that losses were spread across demographic groups and types of business – no group was immune to negative impacts of social distancing policy mandates and demand shifts. These results build on the findi ngs from a few previous studies of the early effects of the coronavirus on small businesses. Employer business applications as measured by the U.S. Census weekly Business Formation Statistics fell in the five weeks f rom mid -March to md -April by over percent relative to the previous year (Wilmoth ) . Estimates from the U.S. Census Small Business Pulse Survey indicate that roughly percent of businesses report having a large negative effect from the COVID - pandemic and that only - percent of businesses have enough cash on hand to cover months of operations (U.S. Census Bureau ; Bohn, Mejia and Lafortune ). Bartik et al. () conducted a survey in late March of nearly , small businesses that were members of the Alignable busines s network. They find that percent of businesses are temporarily closed, large reductions in employees, and the majority of businesses have less than one month of cash on hand. T he Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative () survey ed high-revenue Latin x-owned businesses and found that % of respondents reported immediate negative effects such as delayed projects and closure from the pandemic. This paper is the first to use CPS data covering the early effects of COVID - mandates and demand shifts on small businesses , and the first to explore differential effects for female, minority and immigrant business owners, which is potentially important for targeting government aid to preserve small businesses and the jobs they create. .Da ta Large literatures explore the causes and consequences of disparities in ownership and success of minority -, female - , and immigrant -owned businesses. For broader discussions and reviews of th ese literature, see, for example, Davila and Mora (); Fairlie and Robb (); Jennings and Brush () ; Kerr and Kerr. (); Parker (). . Current Population Survey (CPS) Although research on small businesses and entrepreneurship is growing rapidly, there are very few national datasets that provide information on ownership with additional information on demographic characteristics of the owners . Using micro data from the Current Population Surveys (CPS), I measure self-employed business ownership at the individual owner level. The underlying datasets are the bas ic monthly files to the Current Population Survey (CPS). These surveys, conducted monthly by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, are representative of the entire U.S. population and contain observations for more than , people. Measures of the number and rate of business ownership are available from only a handful of other large, nationally representative government datasets, such as the Survey of Business Owners (SBO), Census PUMS files, and the American Community Survey (ACS). Measures of business ownership based on these cross -sectional data, however, cannot capture recent patterns because there is often a to year delay in release . The CPS is ideal in that it release microdata within a month of the survey week . The measure of business ownership in the CPS captures all business owners including those who own incorporated or unincorporated businesses, and those who are employers or non - employers. Although some business owners own large businesses the predominate form are small businesses. I interpret the data as predominately covering small business owners. To estimate business ownership in the CPS data, I identify all individuals who own a busin ess as their main job in the survey month (based on the class of worker question and monthly labor force recode) . The business ownership rate is thus defined as the percentage of the labor force that owns and is actively employed in a business. The main job is defined as the one with the most hours worked during the survey week. Thus, individuals who start side businesses will not be counted if they are working more hours on a wage and salary job. In addition to providing information on business ownership , the CPS data include information on detailed demographic information including gender, race, and immigrant status of the owner . The data also include information on the industry and incorporation status of the business. Sur vey Timing and Shelte r-in-Place Restrictions The CPS survey reference period is generally the calendar week that contains the 12th day of the month. For April, the week was Sunday, April 12th through Saturday, April 18th. The March survey reference week was March 8th through March 14th. Given that shelter -in-place restrictions started after this reference week, the April is the first CPS survey fully covering the early -stage impacts of COVID -. On March , San Francisco Bay Area imposed shelter -in-place restriction s followed by the State of California on March . New York State followed the next day. By early April all state imposed social distancing restrictions. The analysis below mostly relies on comparisons between February (prior to social distancing policy mandates) and April ( the first month after policy mandates). . Results . Number of Business Owners I first examine small business owners hip patterns over time to determine the impacts of COVID- . Long- term trends in the number of business owners are displayed in Figure (and recent months in Table ) . The number of business owners working any amount and working at least hours in the survey week are reported. The choice of hours is made to approximate two days a week and accommodate lumpy hours reporting (i.e. often , , , etc…). Over the past two decades, the number of business owners in the United States has shown relatively smooth patterns over time with a slight upward trend. What is clear, however, is the dramatic drop in the number of business owners in April . The number of working business owners dropped from . million in February to . million in April because of COVID - . March only shows a small drop in business owners because of the limited effect from shelter -in-place restrictions. The loss of . million business owners (or percent) from February to April was the largest drop on record. When conditioning on working roughly two days per week, the losses are even lar ger. There were . million business owners working + hours in February and only . million in April . The drop of . million business owners or percent was In most analyses March is not included b ecause of partial effects. On March , the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID - a pandemic which might h ave resulted in early demand shifts over health concerns predating shelter-in -place restriction policies."

The Impact of Covid- on Small Business Owners: Evidence of Early-Stage Losses from the April Current Population Survey Robert W. Fairlie NBER Working Paper No. June JEL No. J15,J16,L26 ABSTRACT Social distancing restrictions and demand shifts from COVID- are expected to shutter many small businesses, but there is very little early evidence on impacts. This paper provides the first analysis of impacts of the pandemic on the number of active small businesses in the United States using nationally representative data from the April CPS – the first month fully capturing early effects from the pandemic. The number of active business owners in the United States plummeted by . million or percent over the crucial two-month window from February to April . The drop in business owners was the largest on record, and losses were felt across nearly all industries and even for incorporated businesses. African-American businesses were hit especially hard experiencing a percent drop. Latinx business owners fell by percent, and Asian business owners dropped by percent. Simulations indicate that industry compositions partly placed these groups at a higher risk of losses. Immigrant business owners experienced substantial losses of percent. Female-owned businesses were also disproportionately hit by percent. These findings of early-stage losses to small businesses have important policy implications and may portend longer-term ramifications for job losses and economic inequality. Robert W.

Introduction The widespread closing of stores and businesses in th e Un ited States and ar ound the world due to the coronavirus is unprecedented. Stores, factories and many o ther businesses have closed by policy mandate or downward demand shifts. Many of these c losure s may be permanent b ecause of the inabili ty to pa y ongoing e xpenses a nd survive t he shutdown. The impact on small busines ses ar ound t he world is likely t o be severe. Although the e ffects o f COVID- on the e conomy showed up quickly i n the stock market, t he real es tate market an d unemployment cl aims, the effects o n small business a re not well k nown because of t he lack o f timely business- level data released by the government. This paper addr esses this limi tation by creating es timates of the nu mber of business owner s from monthly Curr ent Population S urvey (CPS) micro data files. Using t hese timely da ta, I ex amine how COVID- impacted small business owners in mid- April – the f irst month to c apture the w ide-spread s helter -in-place restrictions in the United S tates. T he CPS da ta are used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (B LS) to track unem ployment r ates, and have been used in previous research to study determinants o f business o wnership (e.g. recently, L evine and R ubenstein , Wang , Fairlie and Fossen ) . The data allow for a n analysis of r ecent trends in the nu mber o f business owners by business cha racteristics s uch as co rporation s tatus and industry, an d demographic characteristics such as gender, r ace, an d immigrant s tatus. This study provides the first es timates o f the early -stage effects o f COVID- on small business owners fr om April CPS microdata . I find that the number of working business owners plummeted from . million in February to . million in April because of COVID- mandates and demand shifts .
