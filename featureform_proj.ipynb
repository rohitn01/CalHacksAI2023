       "'Most major industries faced large drops in the number of business owners with the only exception being agriculture. Construction, restaurants, hotels and transportation all faced large declines in the number of business owners due to COVID -. Simulations reveal that the concentrations of female, black, Latinx and Asian businesses in industries hit hard by the pandemic contributed to why losses were higher for these groups than the national average loss. Overall, these first estimates of impacts of COVID - on small business es from the April CPS indicate that losses were spread across demographic groups and types of business – no group was immune to negative impacts of social distancing policy mandates and demand shifts. These results build on the findi ngs from a few previous studies of the early effects of the coronavirus on small businesses. Employer business applications as measured by the U.S. Census weekly Business Formation Statistics fell in the five weeks f rom mid -March to md -April by over percent relative to the previous year (Wilmoth ) . Estimates from the U.S. Census Small Business Pulse Survey indicate that roughly percent of businesses report having a large negative effect from the COVID - pandemic and that only - percent of businesses have enough cash on hand to cover months of operations (U.S. Census Bureau ; Bohn, Mejia and Lafortune ). Bartik et al. () conducted a survey in late March of nearly , small businesses that were members of the Alignable busines s network. They find that percent of businesses are temporarily closed, large reductions in employees, and the majority of businesses have less than one month of cash on hand. T he Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative () survey ed high-revenue Latin x-owned businesses and found that % of respondents reported immediate negative effects such as delayed projects and closure from the pandemic. This paper is the first to use CPS data covering the early effects of COVID - mandates and demand shifts on small businesses , and the first to explore differential effects for female, minority and immigrant business owners, which is potentially important for targeting government aid to preserve small businesses and the jobs they create. .Da ta Large literatures explore the causes and consequences of disparities in ownership and success of minority -, female - , and immigrant -owned businesses. For broader discussions and reviews of th ese literature, see, for example, Davila and Mora (); Fairlie and Robb (); Jennings and Brush () ; Kerr and Kerr. (); Parker (). . Current Population Survey (CPS) Although research on small businesses and entrepreneurship is growing rapidly, there are very few national datasets that provide information on ownership with additional information on demographic characteristics of the owners . Using micro data from the Current Population Surveys (CPS), I measure self-employed business ownership at the individual owner level. The underlying datasets are the bas ic monthly files to the Current Population Survey (CPS). These surveys, conducted monthly by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, are representative of the entire U.S. population and contain observations for more than , people. Measures of the number and rate of business ownership are available from only a handful of other large, nationally representative government datasets, such as the Survey of Business Owners (SBO), Census PUMS files, and the American Community Survey (ACS). Measures of business ownership based on these cross -sectional data, however, cannot capture recent patterns because there is often a to year delay in release . The CPS is ideal in that it release microdata within a month of the survey week . The measure of business ownership in the CPS captures all business owners including those who own incorporated or unincorporated businesses, and those who are employers or non - employers. Although some business owners own large businesses the predominate form are small businesses. I interpret the data as predominately covering small business owners. To estimate business ownership in the CPS data, I identify all individuals who own a busin ess as their main job in the survey month (based on the class of worker question and monthly labor force recode) . The business ownership rate is thus defined as the percentage of the labor force that owns and is actively employed in a business. The main job is defined as the one with the most hours worked during the survey week. Thus, individuals who start side businesses will not be counted if they are working more hours on a wage and salary job. In addition to providing information on business ownership , the CPS data include information on detailed demographic information including gender, race, and immigrant status of the owner . The data also include information on the industry and incorporation status of the business. Sur vey Timing and Shelte r-in-Place Restrictions The CPS survey reference period is generally the calendar week that contains the 12th day of the month. For April, the week was Sunday, April 12th through Saturday, April 18th. The March survey reference week was March 8th through March 14th. Given that shelter -in-place restrictions started after this reference week, the April is the first CPS survey fully covering the early -stage impacts of COVID -. On March , San Francisco Bay Area imposed shelter -in-place restriction s followed by the State of California on March . New York State followed the next day. By early April all state imposed social distancing restrictions. The analysis below mostly relies on comparisons between February (prior to social distancing policy mandates) and April ( the first month after policy mandates). . Results . Number of Business Owners I first examine small business owners hip patterns over time to determine the impacts of COVID- . Long- term trends in the number of business owners are displayed in Figure (and recent months in Table ) . The number of business owners working any amount and working at least hours in the survey week are reported. The choice of hours is made to approximate two days a week and accommodate lumpy hours reporting (i.e. often , , , etc…). Over the past two decades, the number of business owners in the United States has shown relatively smooth patterns over time with a slight upward trend. What is clear, however, is the dramatic drop in the number of business owners in April . The number of working business owners dropped from . million in February to . million in April because of COVID - . March only shows a small drop in business owners because of the limited effect from shelter -in-place restrictions. The loss of . million business owners (or percent) from February to April was the largest drop on record. When conditioning on working roughly two days per week, the losses are even lar ger. There were . million business owners working + hours in February and only . million in April . The drop of . million business owners or percent was In most analyses March is not included b ecause of partial effects. On March , the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID - a pandemic which might h ave resulted in early demand shifts over health concerns predating shelter-in -place restriction policies.'"
